# AdventOfCode
My solutions to this year's advent of code problems

Problems can be found at: https://adventofcode.com/
These problems serve as a fun way to practise my c++, a language I do not use on a daily basis. 
Because of this, I am guilty of doing seemingly random things (why are some variables a pointer and others not?! etc) 
mainly because I am playing around with how the language actually works and trying to understand it better at the same time:)
